    <h1> Traveling</h1>
    <h1> HI</h1>
    <div class="line"></div>
    <p> My favorite hobby is travelling. I like all kinds of travel: by car, by train, by plane, and travelling on foot. But I have never travel by the ship yet.
        <br>
        I love to travel with a group and without a guide. Usually, I travel with my family or with my friends. Most of all I like to travel by car and spend a little time at different places. Although long journeys are tiring me sometimes, but that doesn't stop me. First of all, it’s always nice to stay in a different place for a change. Secondly, I’m interested in seeing new sights, exploring different cultures and else. Third, I love to spend time in beautiful places and admire the beauty of the natural attractions such as mountains, waterfalls, forest lakes, seas and oceans, forests, valleys, hills, etc. I have been in the mountains with my family many times. Also I want to visit some European countries. I also want to go in London, Prague, Vienna, Belgrade, Istanbul and in other cities.
        <br>
        Travelling gives me a good opportunity to learn a lot about the history of the country I visit, to see cultural and historical places, to meet people of different nationalities, to learn a lot about their traditions, customs and culture. In other words. I can expand my worldview and my mind. When i grow up I'm going to visit many countries of the world, in various remote and wild places with beautiful scenery such as Colombia, Cambodia, Malaysia, Brazil, Nepal.
